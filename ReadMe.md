## The Challenge: Serving a Passionate and Demanding Niche

The anime community is one of the most passionate in the world. They expect high-quality video, accurate subtitles, and timely access to new episodes as they air in Japan (simulcasts). A successful anime platform must compete not only with large, general-purpose streaming services but also with a culture of fan-subbed and pirated content.

The challenge was to build a platform that could win the loyalty of this discerning audience by delivering a superior, dedicated experience that catered specifically to their needs—from content discovery to the viewing experience itself.

## Our Solution: A Streaming Experience Built By Fans, For Fans

Gamespacelab developed Animie as a premium destination for anime lovers. We focused on the details that matter most to the community, creating a platform that feels both authentic and technologically advanced. We combined a high-performance streaming backend with a user interface rich with features tailored to the anime viewing journey.

The result is an app that respects the content and the community, fostering a dedicated user base.

### Key Features

* **Simulcast Calendar & Notifications:** An integrated calendar tracks upcoming episode releases from Japan. Users can subscribe to their favorite shows and receive push notifications the moment a new episode is available with subtitles.

* **Customizable Subtitle Engine:** We built a highly-customizable video player that allows users to change subtitle font size, color, and background to ensure optimal readability on any device.

* **Advanced Discovery & Curation:** Beyond standard genres, we implemented a deep tagging system that allows users to discover new series based on specific themes, art styles, and tropes (e.g., #Isekai, #Mecha, #Shonen).

* **Community Integration:** Users can create and share public watchlists, rate individual episodes, and participate in spoiler-protected discussions, building a vibrant community directly within the platform.

## Technology Stack

Leveraging our expertise in building scalable media platforms, we used a robust, cloud-native architecture to power Animie.

* **Cross-Platform App:** **React Native** for a unified and fluid user experience on both iOS and Android.
* **Backend:** A highly available **Node.js** backend running on AWS to manage user profiles, watch histories, and content metadata.
* **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS):**
    * **AWS S3 & CloudFront:** For secure storage and low-latency global delivery of video content.
    * **AWS Elemental MediaConvert:** To automate video processing and subtitle integration for simulcast releases.
* **Database:** **PostgreSQL** for its reliability in managing complex relationships between series, episodes, and user data.
